## Simple Tracker for VS Code

I wanted a tracker to see where my times goes inside of VS Code. I didn't want to use a 3rd party service to do it. So, I built this to track usage by day and write to a JSON file.

#### Tracks

* Workspace folder names
* Seconds with that workspace open
* What branches you edited on
* What extensions you're working on and how many times you saved/edited them

#### How to view current metrics

Use the status bar item which shows you the last day and seven day usage.
